# UAV-Swarm-for-Optimized-Communication-Coverage-via-DQN

This repository contains a demo using DQN to solve the sub-problem 1 in the paper [Optimal Charging Profile Design for Solar-Powered Sustainable UAV Communication Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10278505/proceeding)

We trained a UAV communication network on a group of random user distributions using DQN, and used differential rewards function design to make every UAV converge to the optimal position in the horizontal direction.

## üìÅ Project Structure
- `DQN 2UAV.py` - Train UAVs
- `DQN 2UAV test` - Test UAVs after train

## üöÄ Usage
Train
```bash
python DQN 2UAV.py
```

Test
```bash
python DQN 2UAV test.py
```
